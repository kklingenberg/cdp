# CDP Examples

This folder has several CDP examples that illustrate various
uses. They also serve as a test bed for changes to CDP.

Each example is run using [docker compose
V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/) (although V1 should
work too). Inside each folder you'll find a `pipeline.yaml` file, a
`docker-compose.yml` file, and other example-specific files. Each
folder will also have a `README.md` that explains which CDP feature is
being shown.
