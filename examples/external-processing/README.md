# Example: External processing

This example illustrates the use of external processing services which
receive events via HTTP and respond with transformed events.

The example is interactive. To run it, use:

```bash
docker compose run --rm cdp
```

And type in numbers into standard input, using one line for each
number. Use `Ctrl-D` to end the stream.
